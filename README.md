# Security-Correlation-Checking-System-Implementation-for-Stock-and-ETF

We identified the importance of correlation checking for security analysis when investors are making investment decisions, and designed a security correlation checking system for stock and ETF in the US. We then designed and engineered the back-end data warehouse using MongoDB and SQL, data ETL (extract, transform, load) process pipeline using Python and API integration, and front-end user interface using Dash. 

We summarized these key points and considerations for this system implementation in a final [presentation](Implementation_Presentation_Slides.pdf). 
1. Background and definition of the data analytics problem
2. Data source specification and procurement details
3. Implemented design choices and the rationale for using the selected technologies
4. Applicable data quality dimensions, licensing, scalability, & cost implications
5. Conclusion and future recommendations

This is the our implementation design flow.
