# Security-Correlation-Checking-System-Implementation-for-Stock-and-ETF

We identified the importance of correlation checking for security analysis when investors are making investment decisions, and designed a security correlation checking system for stock and ETF in the US. We implemented the back-end data warehouse using MongoDB, data ETL (extract, transform, load) process pipeline using Python and API integration, and front-end user interface using Dash.
